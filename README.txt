This is the Dijkstra project from the group Bassauer/Spix (Berufskolleg für
Wirtschaft und Verwaltung, Aachen). The program contains a travel information
desk which determines the shortest path between two airports. The pathfinder
can also handle undirected and disconnected graphs. Airport metadata and Con-
nections are saved in JSON format and can easily maintained with a graphical
WYSIWYG editor.
